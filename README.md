*Port of Octave scripts to determine planetary positions* 

## About

PlanetaryPositions is a Julia package to perform calculations of the positions 
of the planets in our solar system.  I use the calculations from 
Paul Schlyter, Stockholm, Sweden and his tutorial available at 
http://stjarnhimlen.se/ .

These files constitute an effort to understand how to build a package for 
Julia and to use it for software development.  I am moving files from a set
of Octave scripts which allow for calculations of the positions of the 
planets.  These are a poorly done hack and I will be spending my time making
them look better and converting the syntax from .m files to .jl.
